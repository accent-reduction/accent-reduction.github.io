<p>In this website, you can find a lot of information on how to lose a foreign accent and get an American accent.
The accent reduction community is small, but it has a number of passionate people. Foreign actors who want to make it in Hollywood. Professors from abroad who want to convey lectures with a clear, American accent. Accent reduction teachers who know everything about the American accent.
Unfortunately, a lot of the information about accent reduction is scattered around the internet. This website has websites, books, and everything else I found to be useful for accent reduction students in the hope of helping the accent reduction community.
